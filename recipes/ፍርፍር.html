    <h3>FirFir</h3>
    <p>
        Also known as fitfit, this dish is made of small pieces of shredded taita that are mixed with lots of <br/>
        sauce from a leftover tsebhi. The taita and the sauce are stir-fried together so that the bread absorbs the<br/>
        sauce and softens. It is typically eaten for breakfast as a way to use.

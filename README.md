# odin-recipes
#First Odin Project. 

## Languages Used 
1. HTML ðŸ’¯

## Description
In this project I created an Eritrean Cuisine recipes webpage with 3 recipes. Each one of the recipes in its own page and linked them all together. 

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project was to put into practice the HTML that I have been learning by applying it in a project. 

## Reflection
- I found it to be harder but rewarding to apply knowledge than learning it theoretically. 
- I learned quite many and powerful shortcuts for VS Code in the process. 
- I am ready for another project like never before.
